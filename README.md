# Identify_Customer_Segments
Identify customer segments by analyzing population data and cross-checking with current customer data using principal component analysis (PCA) and kmeans clustering.

**NOTE**
Due to terms of agreement between Udacity and sponsor company, .csv files cannot be made available. This project was done with real population and customer data!
